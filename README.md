# hand-gesture-recognition-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures. The system classifies grayscale images of hand signs (Aâ€“Z, excluding J and Z due to motion) into their respective letters, aiming to support communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired.
